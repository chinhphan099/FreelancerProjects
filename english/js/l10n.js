    conversation:'Peering into the future seldom produces a clear picture. But this is not the [blank_1] with bioenergy. Its long-term impacts on the global economy appear to be pretty clear, making many longterm predictions quite compelling, including the demise of the price-setting power of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the end of agricultural protectionism. First, technology is [blank_2] to deliver a biofuel that will be competitive with fossil energy at something like current prices. It probably already has. Brazil has been exporting ethanol to the US at an average delivery price of $1.45 for an amount with the energy equivalence of a gallon of petrol. It is doing so profitably and in increasing amounts, in spite of a 54 cents a gallon tariff to protect American maize-based ethanol [blank_3]. Many countries are following suit. But ethanol is an inconvenient chemical compound that is corrosive and soluble in water, thus limiting its immediate market to that of a gasoline additive. However, this is just the Betamax phase of the industry. There is plenty of private venture capital money being [blank_4] into finding more efficient ways of extracting energy from biomass and delivering it to transport and power systems. Over time, the technology will also become more flexible, allowing more crops to be used as feedstock, not just the current choice of sugarcane, maize and palm oil. New technologies will be able to extract energy from cellulose, allowing the use of pastures such as switch grass as well as the refuse of current food production.',

    conversation:'Global climate change is the greatest environmental challenge we face. We have at most a few decades to make the necessary investments to prevent the most serious impacts of climate change. Future generations will judge us based on the investments we are considering now. In its February 2007 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that global emissions must peak no later than 2015 if we are to hold average global temperature increases to 2.4Â°C (4.3Â°F) or less. Moving to an emissions pathway that will hold temperature increases to a minimum will require a [blank_1] effort. There is no time to lose given the long lag in research and development cycles, and energy-intensive [blank_2] and product turnover. Fundamentally, [blank_3] the world"s energy system is unlikely to occur within this timeframe. It is thus imperative to find means to reduce the footprint of the existing system - most particularly, of coal, which is the most greenhouse gas intensive of the fossil fuels driving climate change. It is in this context that Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration (CCS) becomes one of the most critical technologies in the menu of choices. It is the only option that provides a potentially near-term solution to rapidly expanding coal use here, in China and around the world. CCS must play the critical role of [blank_4] growth in emissions from coal until other alternatives are ready.',

It was just a combination of the other four qualities (salty, sweet, bitter, sour)", explained Dr. Stephen Roper, the University of Miami physiology and biophysics professor who helped zero in on the taste along with Nirupa Chaudhari, the team"s lead researcher.',

    conversation:'The Eiffel Tower is an iron tower built on the Champ de Mars beside the River Seine in Paris. It is the tallest structure in Paris and among the most [blank_1] symbols in the world. The structure was built between 1887 and 1889 as the entrance arch for the Exposition Universelle, a World Fair marking the centennial celebration of the French Revolution. The tower was [blank_2] on March 31, 1889, and opened on May 6. The tower is constructed of 18,038 pieces of wrought iron held together with three and a half million rivets. Because of this design, the risk of accident was great, for unlike modern skyscrapers the tower is an open [blank_3] without any intermediate floors, except the two platforms. Yet, because Eiffel took safety precautions including use of guard-rails and screens, only one man died, during the installation of its elevators. Named after its designer, engineer Gustave Eiffel, it is a premier tourist destination. On the Eiffel Tower, seventy-two names of French scientists, engineers and some other notable people are engraved in recognition of their contributions by Gustave Eiffel. This engraving was painted over at the beginning of the twentieth century and restored in 1986-1987 by SociÃ©tÃ© Nouvelle d"exploitation de la Tour Eiffel, a [blank_4] contracted to operate business related to the Tower. The Tower is owned by the city of Paris.',

The only hill station in Rajasthan, Mount Abu is more than just a summer retreat. Its stunning array of exquisite Dilwara Jain Temples, dating back to 11th-13th centuries, makes it a popular pilgrimage [blank_4]. Abu, according to a legend, stands for the son of Himalaya, deriving its name from Arbuada, the powerful serpent who rescued Nandi, known as the sacred bull of Lord Shiva, from a chasm. Mount Abu has been home to many sages and saints. Most famous of them was Sage Vashishtha who is believed to have created four agnikula Rajput clans from a fire-pit by performing a yagna or fire sacrifice, to protect the earth from the demons.',
